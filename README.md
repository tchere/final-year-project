# ðŸ“˜ Final Year Project: Measureing RÃ©nyi Entanglement entropy in 1-D Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) using Monte Carol simulation 

## ðŸ”¬ Overview

This project explores the **1-D Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM)**â€”a foundational model in quantum many-body physics and quantum phase transitions. A key focus of this work is the **computation of entanglement entropy** using **Monte Carlo simulations**, enabling to understand more about the quantum critical behavior of the system.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Calculate **entanglement entropy**, especially **RÃ©nyi entropy** varying in different system size of TFIM
- Calculate the magnetization of 2-D classical ising model and 2-D tranverse field ising model
- Anylzing the critical behavior of those model
- Match the slope result with the Conformal field theory

## ðŸ§® Methods
- **Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC)** espeically on Metropolis and Wloff Algorithm
- imaginary time Replica trick (for RÃ©nyi entropy calculation)
- Visualization of entropy scaling and phase transition behavior

## Significant Result
- The simulation result with the transformed X axis match the theoretical result from the Conformal Field Theory (CFT),
