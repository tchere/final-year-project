# ðŸ“˜ Final Year Project: 1-D Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) in Monte Carol simulation 

## ðŸ”¬ Overview

This project investigates the **1-D Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM)**, a fundamental model in quantum many-body physics and quantum phase transitions. The TFIM serves as a minimal model for studying quantum criticality and entanglement in spin systems.
